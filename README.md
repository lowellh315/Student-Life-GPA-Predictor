# Student-Life-GPA-Predictor
Project attempting to replicate the results of the smartGPA Paper using the Student Life Dataset. This is the paper: https://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/smartgpa.pdf

The Indoor Mobility and Partying files are created from the respective indoor mobility and analyze partying notebooks. Since these take a long time to run, I included those files and loaded them in the final predictor, called GPA Predictor.

Since the sensor processing takes a long time to run, it will be easier to download the Indoor Mobility, Partying, and Class attendance files along with the sensor data and change the filepaths in the beginning of the predictor code. 

I also used preprocessed sensor data that can be found here: https://github.com/karzak/StudentLife
