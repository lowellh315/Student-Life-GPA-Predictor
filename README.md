# Student-Life-GPA-Predictor
Project attempting to replicate the results of the smartGPA Paper using the Student Life Dataset. This is the paper: https://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/smartgpa.pdf

The Indoor Mobility and Partying files are created from the respective indoor mobility and analyze partying notebooks. Since these take a long time to run, I included those files and loaded them in the final predictor, called GPA Predictor.
